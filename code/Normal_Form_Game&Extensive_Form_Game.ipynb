The payoffs for each player are determined by both players' actions, and are designed in a way that the optimal outcome for each player (both players keep silent) is inferior to the worst outcome for each player (both betray). The modified version have added more years for both betraying and decreased the years that one player  keeps silent and another betrays.\n",
